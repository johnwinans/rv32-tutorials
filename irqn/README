# The same as the IRQ app but using the library and supports more than 
# one hart!

	This code does not work properly with multiple cores due to 
	inconsistent emulator timing.  Consider starting each hart 
	at a different address?


##############################################################
# This is intended to be run with 8 cores like this:

qemu-system-riscv32 -machine virt -m 128M -smp cpus=8 -bios none -device loader,file=./prog -nographic -s


##############################################################
# To stop qemu: ^A x


riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb ./prog
target remote :1234
info thread
info registers
info registers csr
