# Run with one hart like this:

#qemu-system-riscv32 -machine virt -m 128M -bios none -device loader,addr=0x80000000,cpu-num=0 -device loader,file=./prog -nographic -s
qemu-system-riscv32 -machine virt -m 128M -bios none -device loader,file=./prog -nographic -s



# Run with multiple harts like this:

qemu-system-riscv32 -machine virt -m 128M -smp cpus=2 -bios none -device loader,addr=0x80000000,cpu-num=0 -device loader,file=./prog -nographic -gdb tcp::1234


# To stop qemu: ^A x

# Add a -v flag to the loader to ask it to dump the ld script that it is using!
# (diff it with the hacked one I created for this app)
